# Windows-Log-Parser
A log parser for a windows machine
This script parses Windows Event Logs (Application, Security, and System) from .evtx files using the Evtx module, extracts key fields, and displays them in a sortable PrettyTable format for analysis. It is useful for security analysts, incident responders, or sysadmins working with local event logs.
I used as few libraries as possible in order to learn more about parsing XML and extracting data using built-in Python functions
